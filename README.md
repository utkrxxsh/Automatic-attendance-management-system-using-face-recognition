Attendance management system using OpenCV and python . The attendance system uses webcam to record the attendance of students in a classroom with some time interval in a day.  All the entries are automatically saved live in a excel sheet .

The algorithm first trains using the images provided to it and records the encodings related to every face . When frames from webcam are fed , it detects all the faces, project them in the correct perspective , encodes them and sees which person has the closest measurements to our faceâ€™s measurements. This is the match ! The name of the person is nothing but the filename of that image previously used in training the model . These features are provided in the following api : https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition#face-recognition .
